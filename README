This is a total hack!

appinv.py is an implementation of the MIT App Inventor backend written
in Python. It is based on reverse engineering the GWT RPC calls used
by App Inventor.

What is here is a Proof Of Concept (also a total hack, did I say that
already? Yeah, I thought so). It automatically logs you in as
test@example.com and shows one project (a hacked up version of
HelloPurr). It does not yet implement project creation or even project
saving.

This code *might* be usable as a starting point for App Inventor “in a
Box.”
