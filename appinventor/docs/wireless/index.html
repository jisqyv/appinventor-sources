        Wireless Phone Connection Test

       <p><b>Update October 9, 2012: Read our <a href="news.html">News Update.</a>.</b></p>
       <p>
         Welcome to the MIT App Inventor wireless test. Instead of using the USB cable to connect
         your phone to your computer, you use a WiFi connection instead. Both your phone and computer need to
         be able to communicate with each other over the network. Normally this means that both are connected
         to the same WiFi network, but isn't necessary. The compute can be connected to a wired network drop
         while the phone can be on a local WiFi network. As long as data can get from the PC to the phone, things should work.
       </p>
       <p>
         Note: If your phone is not on a WiFi network but is instead connected to the Internet via the Cell Phone Carrier, this
         system will not work.
       </p>

              Step 1:
            </b>
            Download and install the App Inventor Debug App and install it on your phone. You can download it here: <a href="/wireless/AppInventorDebugApp.apk">AppInventorDebugApp.apk</a>. This is a version of the Application that is normally installed via the
            USB cable. However because we are not using a USB cable, you need to manually install it. You MUST use this version.
          </p>
          <p>
            This QR Code will bring you to the version in the Google Play Store:<br />
            <img src="/wireless/store.png" width="300" height="300">
          </p>
          <p>Note: When we update the MIT App Inventor Server an older versions of the App Inventor Debug App will likely stop working. We will put up a message
            on the server before we plan an upgrade. You can then download the new version of the App Inventor Debug App prior to the server upgrade. The newer
            version of the App will work with the older (current) server.</p>
          <p>If you download the App from the Play Store, we recommend that you check the "Allow automatic updating" box on the installation screen.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>
          Step 2:
         </b>
          From the blocks editor, select the "Connect Wifi" button. You will be shown a dialog box with a alpha-numeric code. DO NOT HIT "OK" YET. A QR code will also be displayed.
          </li>
        <li>
          <b>
            Step 3:
            </b>
          Start the App Inventor Debug App on your phone (you can
          launch it like a normal Android application). It will have a
          text box where you enter the code displayed in step 2. Press "Go!."
          <br /><br />
          Alternatively, if your phone has a camera, and an
          appropriate bar code scanning application, you can select
          the "Scan" button on the Debug App and scan the QR code
          displayed above. If you use the Scan button, you do not have
          to enter the displayed code or press the "Go!"  button.
          <br /><br />
          </li>
        <li>
          <b>
            Step 4:
            </b>
          Now press the OK button on the dialog box in the blocks
          editor. Your phone should now display your application. If
          you typed in the wrong code, you should see an error
          dialog. If this happens, restart the App Inventor Debug App
          on your phone (use the "Back" key to exit and start it
          again. Go back to Step 2.
          </li>
        </ul>
       <p>
         If you have trouble connecting, make sure your phone is using
         WiFi and not the cell network. On some phones and locations
         even with WiFi enabled, the phone continues to use the cell
         network for Internet connectivity. If this may be happening
         to you, you can disable mobile networking (cell based Internet
         connectivity) from your phone's Android settings menu.
